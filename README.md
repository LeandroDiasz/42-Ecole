# 42-Pool Repository

Welcome to my 42-Pool repository!

This repository documents my journey through the Ecole 42 selection process, known as the "pool". Here, you will find the challenges and projects I completed during the rigorous selection phase. Each directory represents an individual exercise or project, containing source code, documentation, and related materials.

Feel free to explore and review the projects. Comments and feedback are always appreciated!


## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/LeandroDiasz/42-Pool.git>
cd 42-Pool
